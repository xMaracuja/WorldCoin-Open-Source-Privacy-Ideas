Community WLD researchers

I'm not part of the team, just a fan of the project, but I also see the long term implications of it, and want to ensure everyone in the community is able to contribute to ensure long-term security and human responsability of the project. 

All ideas and concerns are welcome, as long as they are intelligent and constructive.
